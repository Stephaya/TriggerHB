# Trigger Homebrew

This Tabletop Homebrew ruleset is inspired by Tactical Games and made to fit within the TableTop Gameplay Format. This Homebrew is made to be easy for novices; however, it leaves just enough complexity for higher level players to utilize and enjoy the unique combat system present. This Homebrew gives players more creative freedom to act. Many new Mechanics introduce new Opportunities for the Players to Use.

Battles are Dynamic. Battles are Fast. Battles are Concentrated.
